History
=======

0.13.0 - (2026-05-19)
---------------------
* Expand knowledge base from owner Q&A (Dudas_V2.pdf): 14 new FAQs and 9 new policies covering food/meals, photos/videos, operating hours, closed days (Dec 25 + Jan 1), Barú ≠ Islas del Rosario clarification, private services, package certification requirements, overnight courses, Divemaster payment structure, DIVE TO HEAL adaptive diving program, and free island pickup.
* Re-index embeddings: updated `load_embeddings.py` to include COP prices from `services.json` and full `pricing.json` indexing; KB grows from 377 → 441 documents.
* Add 80 new conversation tests (207 total): RAG routing for new KB topics, adaptive diving not escalating, and tree response content validation.
* Fix supervisor routing: word-boundary regex for escalation keywords (prevents "persona" false positive), strip trailing punctuation in `_is_substantive_free_text` ("hey?" routes to welcome), and greeting restart (any greeting mid-flow resets to language selection).
* Add DIVE TO HEAL explicit exception to RAG system prompt (ES + EN): disability/accessibility questions answered with program facts, not escalated as medical.
* Add Chatwoot auto-assign: new conversations are assigned to `CHATWOOT_OWNER_AGENT_ID` via API so they appear in the owner's "Mine" view without relying solely on Chatwoot UI auto-assignment.
* Resize Chatwoot test widget (chatwood-test.html) to 680px × 88vh with MutationObserver to survive SDK style resets.

0.12.0 - (2026-05-15)
---------------------
* Implement real Chatwoot human handoff by toggling escalated conversations to `pending` after sending the internal lead note.
* Add Chatwoot regression coverage for handoff delivery and failed-handoff retry preservation.
* Harden decision-tree language detection to avoid false English positives from Spanish inputs such as `en español`.

0.11.0 - (2026-05-13)
---------------------
* Add automatic lead-summary private notes in Chatwoot on escalation (keyword, sensitive, and tree-triggered).
* Rewrite RAG system prompt with brand_tone.json: WhatsApp style, explicit prohibitions, escalation criteria.
* Fix snorkeling bug: group_type choice 4 from islands now maps to the correct island variant.
* Add exhaustive conversation test dataset (127 tests, 18 blocks covering all tree paths, escalation, RAG, PII, English flows, lead summaries, and quick replies).
* Add /runtests Claude Code skill with block-level keyword filtering.
* Fix dev environment: Chatwoot webhook was pointing to port 8001 instead of 8000; add message_updated event subscription so button clicks reach the bot.
* Replace Windows-incompatible country flag emojis (🇨🇴/🇺🇸) with universally supported globe emojis (🌎/🌐).

0.10.0 - (2026-05-13)
---------------------
* Align the decision tree with `services.json` as the service source of truth.
* Add guided coverage for island service variants and PADI specialties.
* Expand curated FAQs with beginner diving knowledge, safety guidance, equipment basics, course comparisons, and marine-life guidance.
* Update visual tree docs, MVP KB audit, and decision-tree tests.

0.9.0 - (2026-05-12)
--------------------
* Define MVP direction around informing, qualifying, recommending, and preparing human-assisted conversion.

* Add a simple infrastructure diagram and strengthen session close workflow traceability.

0.8.0 - (2026-05-11)
--------------------
* Improve Cartagena decision-tree branches for beginners, snorkeling, private services, and certified multi-day packages.
* Add safety/privacy tests and remove raw WhatsApp exports/backups from Git tracking.

0.7.0 - (2026-05-10)
--------------------
* Upgrade the certified-diver `2 dives / 1 day` branch with clearer flow logic and Spanish documentation.

0.6.0 - (2026-05-08)
--------------------
* Implement real Chatwoot `input_select` buttons for decision-tree menus.

0.5.0 - (2026-05-07)
--------------------
* Add multi-environment infrastructure for dev, pre, and pro deployments.
